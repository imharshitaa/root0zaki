# Building DevSecOps Workflow

DevSecOps is the practice of adding security into the DevOps pipeline. Instead of waiting until after development to run security tests, checks are done throughout the lifecycle from writing code to deploying and monitoring applications.

This approach reduces risks, catches vulnerabilities earlier, and helps deliver software that is both fast and secure.

## Why DevSecOps?

Traditional security often slows down software delivery because testing is done late. DevSecOps solves this problem by:

- Shifting security left → Tests run early, so issues are fixed quickly.
- Automation → Security scans run in CI/CD without slowing developers.
- Team collaboration → Developers, operations, and security teams share responsibility.
- Continuous protection → Apps stay secure even after deployment with monitoring.

## Workflow Stages

A DevSecOps pipeline has five key stages:

**Code**
- Developers write code following secure practices.
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools check for weak patterns, unsafe functions, or hardcoded secrets.

**Build**
- CI pipelines package the application.
- Dependency and library scans (SCA) detect vulnerabilities in third-party components.

**Test**
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools simulate real-world attacks.
- APIs, web apps, and containers are tested for vulnerabilities.
- Fuzzing and penetration testing can be added for deeper coverage.

**Deploy**
- Applications are deployed in containers or cloud environments.
- Container images are scanned for risks.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is checked to ensure secure configurations.

**Monitor**
- Logs, metrics, and alerts are continuously monitored.
- Threat detection tools track suspicious activity in real time.
- Feedback loops ensure new risks are patched quickly.

## Tools for Security Testing

1. SAST (Code Analysis): SonarQube, Semgrep
2. SCA (Dependency Scans): Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check
3. DAST (Dynamic Testing): OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
4. Container Security: Trivy, Anchore
5. IaC Security: Checkov, Kics
6. Monitoring & Runtime Security: Grafana, Prometheus, Falco

**Conclusion:**

`DevSecOps is not just about tools, it’s about ensuring security is built into the development workflow. 
By securing code, dependencies, deployments, and monitoring systems, teams can release applications quickly without sacrificing safety.`
