# Pentesting Playbook

This is a pentesting playbook for working on penetration testing and vulnerability assessments according to the scope required.

### Goal:

Discover realistic attack paths, produce clear evidence, and provide prioritized, actionable remediation so teams can fix what matters first.

For: Organizations that want personalized, business focused security testing. 
The emphasis is on repeatable methodology, evidence that security engineers can run with and recommendations that reduce real operational risk.

## 2. Scope:

Web Applications: <br>
OWASP Top 10, authentication, session management, authorization logic, input validation, and business logic.

APIs: <br>
REST and GraphQL checks for authorization, excessive data exposure, injection, and rate-limiting issues.

Network & Infrastructure: <br>
External perimeter reviews, internal network testing when provided, and basic segmentation checks.

Cloud Posture: <br>
Non-privileged audits of AWS/Azure/GCP focusing on IAM, storage, and networking configurations.

Mobile Apps: <br>
Static analysis of application artifacts and focused dynamic checks for basic runtime issues.

Optional Add-ons: <br>
Social engineering or red-team-lite exercises available under separate agreement.

## 3. Sources & References

Testing follows current, reputable guidance and adapts to the target’s architecture and business risk. 

Typical references and influences include:
- OWASP testing guide and ASVS
- Public bug-bounty reports and triage trends
- Technical conference talks and respected security blogs

`Principles: 
prioritize manual validation over blind scanning, focus on realistic attack chains, and keep the test destructive-actions-free unless explicitly authorized.`

## 4. Methodology

`RECONNAISSANCE` 

Build an asset inventory and attack-surface map using passive and non-intrusive techniques. 

Deliverable: asset list and reconnaissance summary.

`SCANNING & ENUMERATION`

Identify reachable services, versions, endpoints, and directories using controlled scans and careful crawling. 

Deliverable: enumerated endpoints and a prioritized surface map.

`VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS` 

Triage and validate findings; separate true issues from false positives; evaluate impact and exploitability. 

Deliverable: validated findings with impact notes.

`PROOF OF CONCEPT`

Demonstrate impact safely with minimal, reversible PoCs. 

Deliverable: redacted PoC artifacts and reproducibility notes.

`REPORTING` 

Deliver an executive summary and a technical section with prioritized remediation and suggested timelines. 
Optional: walkthrough call and retest after fixes. 

Deliverable: draft report → final report (PDF/Markdown) → retest notes.

## 5. Risk rating

**Critical:** Immediate action required. Complete compromise, large data leak, or active exploitation.

**High:** Serious vulnerability with significant impact and low additional complexity.

**Medium:** Meaningful risk requiring certain conditions or combinations of issues.

**Low:** Minor misconfigurations or constrained exposures.

**Informational:** Observations that improve long-term posture.

## 6. Technology used

- Recon & discovery tools for asset mapping.
- Scanners for port and service identification (used in a controlled, non-disruptive way).
- Interception and analysis tools for web and API testing, combined with targeted fuzzing and manual logic review.
- Post-exploitation tooling for approved, scoped internal engagements only.
- Plain-language reports and optional collaboration platforms for larger projects.

## 7. Checklist

- [ ] Signed authorization and scope confirmation.
- [ ] Emergency contact and escalation path; blackout windows if required.
- [ ] Preferences for report format and retest expectations.
- [ ] Access credentials or environment details for privileged/internal tests (if requested).

## 8. Timeline

`Start → Recon → Scan → PoC → Report → Remediate → Retest`

**Outcomes include the final report (PDF/Markdown) and optional retest verification.**

### 9. Legal Ethics and Rules

1. Written authorization only. No testing without agreed scope and signatures.
2. Non-destructive approach. Destructive acts, data exfiltration, or intentional denial-of-service are not performed unless explicitly authorized and coordinated.
3. Confidentiality. Evidence and reports are stored encrypted and shared only with authorized contacts.
4. Responsible disclosure. Coordinate any external timelines if findings affect third parties.
